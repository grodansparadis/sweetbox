a new version of the schemas for the sweetbox. Most parts are in place
now. Missing is power for the RGB LED array because I don't know how
many I can fit in to the $400 budget at the moment. I will try to make
a new video also in a free days showing the progress.<br><br>I have not
been able to determine if I should support other sound then talk for
the audio of the SweetBox. My decision depends on how much juice I can
get out of the PIC32. This is why the schema has two different versions
of the filter section for the audio at the moment. One with a cut of at
about 4000 Hz and one at 21 KHz.<br><br>Added a pressure sensor&nbsp;to be able to record barometric pressure.<br><br>My solder iron is hot know so its time to go back to work. &nbsp;Don't forget to join the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/m2m-development">VSCP mailing list</a> if your are interested in VSCP and also visit the <a href="http://www.vscp.org">VSCP site</a> of course. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We need more bright people!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Stay Hungry - Be Foolish</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br><br><br></body></html>
