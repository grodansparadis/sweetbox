<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><big><big>Update</big></big></p><p>
Been one of those nice weeks when the phone has been quiet most of the
time and I could spend time on my favorite project at the moment, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span>. This with
a quiet phone can somtimes be troublesome. Being&nbsp;an open
source programmer I need to do consulting work to get money to be able
to do the things I dream of doing&nbsp;so It should not be quite
to long either as you all understand. Happens to me to often I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
I have started to verify the prototype. At the moment Ethernet, CAN,
EEPROM's (two 24AA1025), Tempsensor (MCP9801) is verified. I will
attend to IR receiver, IR transmitter, Barometer, Buzzer now but all of
theese are things I have done before so I expect no big problems there.
Next is audio. Both the recording and the output. I expect a lot of
tweking here before it's perfect. <br>
<br>
Then it's time to verify the RF section with the lovely <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRF24J40MA</span>. I would have done
this by now if I had the hardware but have to wait until I get my hands
on some modules. This is completly new to me but my personal main goal
with this project is to implemet VSCP over MiWi. This way I win even
if I don't go to the next phase. I will do this also for the CC2500 and
Simlicity from Texas Instruments but not on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span> at least not if I get
the boards in time. As always this code will be&nbsp;available for free use from the <a href="http://www.vscp.org">VSCP site</a>&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
I kindly got sponsored with a CO2 sensor from the world leading CO2
sensor company <a href="http://www.senseair.se"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SenseAir</span></a>
yesterday. This sensor is not available on <span style="font-weight: bold;">DigiKey</span> (<big style="color: red;">It should be!</big>) and I will
therefore have it outside of my construction. Probably do a VSCP design
around it so the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span>
can use it as any other VSCP module. <br>
<br>
I though I definitly was an ARM man but I must say I like this MIPS
thingi after this initial work. To be honest MPLAB is not my favorite
tool. It's a bit to unstable and unpredictable for that but never the
less I end up using it on most of my project. It's that little
PIC that always makes it in some way in all my designs. Even if latley
theres been a lot of ARM cores to.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I will add support for an external GPRS module also in the firmware.
Easier to&nbsp;contol the thing in remote areas with this added. This means
remote control via text messages or web interface. As the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span> is VSCP aware
a lot of things can be controlled/monitored. Want to remotley fill up the bath tube anyone?<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What can the SweetBox be
used for? </span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Hearing
aid</span><br>
Let the SweetBox light up in different patterns when
different&nbsp; <br>
things are detected on the VSCP network. Let it say some words
to&nbsp; <br>
indicate a certain condition. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;">Baby
sitter </span><br>
Let the SweetBox listen for your kid and inform you when he/she is
awake.&nbsp; <br>
You can even get an SMS when things happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">As
a remote alarm module </span><br>
Connect it to a NC/NO alarm sensor net. Get an email or SMS when
soemthing happens or <br>
let the SweetBox take actions.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Remote
control of cottage heat and more&nbsp;</span><br>
Connect some other VSCP modules to the SweetBox and remotly control
things in your cottage. <br>
What is the temperature? Turn on heat. Alarm? Anyone present? etc etc.
Add things as you need things. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Play
your audio book </span><br>
Play your audio book on the SweetBox. If you have several boxes let the
book follow <br>
you from room to room. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Keep
a nice climate in a room </span><br>
Let the SweetBox control the temperature in your room. Let it tun/on
off radiators. Detect <br>
if windows are open. Detect if a fan need to be started because the air
quality is bad.&nbsp; <br>
React on moister, pressure, temp etc and with everything else via other
VSCP modules. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Leave
a message </span><br>
Record a message on the SweetBox that your kids can listen to when they
arrive home or just&nbsp; <br>
record a reminder of something you need to shop. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;">IR
Remote </span><br>
Let the SweetBox control things with it's IR remote transmitter or be
controled with any IR&nbsp; <br>
remote control. You can use your TV remote to control the Window blinds
and more. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Email/voice
messages </span><br>
Let the SweetBox indicate that you got a message and read it to you if
you want. Let it tell <br>
you the current temperature, pressure, moister level etc <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Remote

&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Energy
Saving </span><br>
Let the SweetBox shutdown unneeded resources when no one is home or

during night.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Alarm
Clock </span><br>
Use the SweetBox as an alarm clock and wake you up in the morning or
remind you of things from <br>
your calender. Let it start your coffy machine, turn on lights increase
the heat just in time to&nbsp; <br>
get your favorite morning location nice and warm. When you go to bed.
Let the SweetBox lock your&nbsp; <br>
doors, shut of water, turn off lights. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">All
this, an more, is possible due to&nbsp;the <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">VSCP
decision matrix</span> that is available in the device.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"></span></p><p>
BTW it would have been nice to know from which countries everyone is
from.</p><p></p><p>
