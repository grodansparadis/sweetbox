<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><big><big>Update</big></big></p> Not much has happened this week on the SweetBox design. Been busy with other VSCP related things.<br><br>Late
tomorrow (we know which designs made it to Phase III. This means that
this can be my last blog entry here so I thought I should take the
chance to write one more and maybe last time. What ever happens
tomorrow it's been great fun to participate with the great people in
the contest. I'm usually not the guy that wins things so my hopes for
tomorrow aren't that high. But of course the hope is there and actually
the felling is a bit like when one was seven years old the day before
X-mas.<br><br>Whatever happens. There is a lot of talent here and most
deserve to move further. For those that does not move to the next phase
we can remember that even guys like Beatles did not get selected on the
first try. If one believe in something it's just to work on....<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
