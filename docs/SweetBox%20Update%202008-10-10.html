Everything is in place at last. That is hardware vise. Need to update
the required items on site also and will do that this weekend.<br>
<br>
I have decide to add a 433MHx transmitter/receiver (for Europe) to the
board also . This is added to be able to control the cheap one way RF
switches etc which there is plenty of on the market today. You have all
seen them and in Sweden they typically look like this<br>

I have added a DAC chip to the design. Will use this for audio output
if the PIC32 can handle the load this oppose of it. If not I will just
use PWM for speech. I noticed that it is a lot of work to get the
filters right to get good sound quality.<br>
<br>
Next week I will do MiWi code. I will implement VSCP over MiWi. This
will also be done for Texas SimpliciTI later also as I been kindly
sponsored by my friend Henk in the Netherlands with a developers kit
for the stuff. This will be fun!&nbsp; <br>
