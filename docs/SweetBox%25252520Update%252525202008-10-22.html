<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><big><big>Update</big></big></p> <br>All
embedded engineers know the feeling of happiness one can feel when
getting a new platform to light up a little red LED. Completely strange
to any one else but an embedded guy can go out and celebrate just
because of this tiny little lit LED. The reason is of course that there
is often a lot of hidden work that has been done before the LED
actually lights up. Many time also visions that now is proven to be
right.<br><br>Back in time when the first version of windows was
released it took about a full day to get the skeleton in place to
actually get an empty window on the screen. The feeling was the same.
Good libraries and RAD tools like Visual Basic changed that and I
remember a room with approximate 3000 developers standing up and
applauding after a Visual Basic development demo where a mouse tracking
application was built in fifteen minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Before
1985/1986 all work I did on micro controllers, Motorola/Hitachi at the
time, was done in assembler. The development cycle sound incredible
today. <br><br>1.) Fix the Bug.<br>2.) Compile the code. Tree to five minutes.<br>3.) Upload the hex file over a serial link to the server where the EEPROM burner is. Five minutes.<br>4.) Walk to the server an insert a new EEPROM.<br>5.) Go back and start the programming of the EEPROM. Six minutes.<br>6.) Walk to the sevrver and get the EEPROM.<br>7.) Insert the EEPROM in the test system.<br><br>Repeat
1-7 until the project is finished. OK forgot. From time to time
EEPROM's needed to be erased also. Took a few hours so it had to be
planned so that EEPROMS where available during the day. <br><br>RAM
was well bellow 100 bytes. Often 50-60 bytes, Meaning that one often
needed to create states in the code so that the firmware could use the
same memory for different things at different places in the program.<br><br>I loved this work then as I love it today. Assembler was my tool. I Excelled in it.<br><br>So one day a guy from <a href="http://www.iar.se">IAR in Uppsala</a> dropped by the office. They where some guys that did C compilers for low end devices. Crazy guys. C on a micro!!!<br><br>I
was convinced wrong of course in a few years and today one is a fool if
one select assembler before C on a micro. It's no meaning with it
accept for very small parts of system critical code. With flash, large
ram, huge code space and speed we even couldn't have imagine at the
time things is getting better. Tools are better. It is even more fun
today!<br><br>At the end of last week I got FreeRTOS + lwIp to compile on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span>
and this was much like the lit LED above. Nothing big but a milestone
and something that gives the positive energy to work further on the
project. The skeleton for a end28j60 driver is in place and a few other
nice bits. Tons of work left before all this is working but fun work.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
