<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><big><big>Update</big></big></p>Continue my work on software for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span>. <a href="http://www.freertos.org/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FreeRTOS</span></a> and <a href="http://www.sics.se/%7Eadam/lwip/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">lwIP</span></a>
is in the works. This is really all I can do while seeing everyone else
in the competition&nbsp;moving past me like racer cars in the voting
system. &nbsp;To many hours in the lab&nbsp;probably. Maybe should have
attended my friends more over the years. Would have been handy now. Oh
well.. what is a night at the castle.... <br>&nbsp;<br>Before I
entered this competition I was definitly an ARM man. I would never even
considered adding a PIC32 to one of my designs. May reconsider that in
the future. Like the beast more and more. ARM &nbsp;suppliers is ahead
on integrated pheriperals like Ethernet etc but I'm sure Microchip is
working on that. In most of my designs it's important that a component
does not diappear suddenly and Microchip is best in that sense far
ahead of anyone else.&nbsp;For low and mid end designs there is no
alternative to the PIC in my toolbox.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
