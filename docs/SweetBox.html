<b>SweetBox - VSCP Room controller</b> <br>
<br>
The <b>SweetBox</b>is a domestic home controller that is
intended to be installed in selected rooms of an apartment or
house. It is a VSCP (Very Simple Control Protocol, <b><a href="http://www.vscp.org">http://www.vscp.org</a></b>)
enabled device and can therefore interact with other low end and high
end VSCP
devices/modules like the ones at the VSCP site sample
section . It is possible to remotely control the module in a secure way
by use of computer or cellular phone. This requires additional tools or
a host computer with VSCP
and friends to be installed.<br>
<br>
What can the <b>SweetBox </b>do?<br>
<br>
With the <b>Ethernet port</b> and the TCP/IP protocol it
can be configured remotely trough a web interface or with the VSCP
protocol. This
also allow for configuration by cellular phone or computer etc in a
standard way. With the VSCP
protocol implemented in the module it can also interact with other VSCP
enbled modules,
such as other SweetBox&#8482;'es in a plug and play fashion.<br>
<br>
A&nbsp;<b>2.4GHz</b> interface which carry VSCP over MiWi is
also available. This allow the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox</b>to
control and interact with wireless VSCP
modules such as external temperature sensors, radiator controllers,
fire alarms etc etc.<br>
<br>
A 433MHz transmitter and receiver makes it possible for the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox
</b>to
handle legacy RF devices,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>CAN bus</b> let the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox </b>directly
use other low cost CAN enabled VSCP
modules.<br>
<b><br>
Ambient Light Sensor</b> can be used to detect if the light is on
in a room or if a light need to be turned on because it's dark and
someone is entering the room.<br>
<b><br>
IR Receiver</b> allow the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox </b>to
understand standard remote controls. It can learn keystrokes and then
use the IR remote control as a controlling device.<br>
<b><br>
A temperature sensor</b> is built into the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox.
</b>Can
be used to sense and control the ambient temperature of the room.<br>
<br>
A <b>Humidity sensor</b> is also built in to monitor the
humidity.<br>
<br>
A <b>proximity sensor</b> is built in to detect humans.
This can be used to find out if someone is in a room and turn of lights
etc if not to save energy. different boxes can interact to see if a
human is returning and light again before the human enters the room.<br>
<br>
A built in <b>loud siren</b> can be used for alarm
conditions.<br>
<br>
A built in <b>sound capability</b> let the&nbsp;<b>SweetBox
</b>stream
audio books, radio and music from in house internal sources or remote
locations. The <b>SweetBox </b><br>
<br>
A built in <b>microphone</b> makes it possible to detect
sound in a room and stream or record sound from a room.
<br>
<br>
Standard <b>NC/NO inputs</b> is available on the SweetBox
to
make it possible to connect standard alarm equipment to it and
translate these to VSCP
events for full control/detection.<br>
<br>
A <b>CO2 sensor</b> is available off board over an RF
interface to
detect the air quality in the room which makes it possible to have
energy efficient control of the ventilation. Many other senors etc can
be used over the RF, TCP/IP or CAN interfaces,<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;<b>SweetBox </b>
is
thin and intended to be installed mounted on a wall. The top cover has
an array with RGB LED's that can produce dynamic artistic patterns. Its
up to the owner if it should be hidden or showed off. A thermostat
setting display can by other things be shown by the LED array.
The&nbsp;<b>SweetBox </b>
can
be used as a stand alone control unit after its decision matrix has
been&nbsp;programmed. It can equally well be connected with other
boxes or computers and servers. As the complete system is plug and play
it is very easy to add and link new equipment together. The speaker an
the LED array is used for user feed back on local commands/settings.
The WEB interface can be used to configure and setup the <b>SweetBox.<br>
