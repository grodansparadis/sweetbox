<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"><big><big>Update</big></big></p>Then
at last everything is in place. A new video is uploaded, BOM, first
software etc. is in place.&nbsp; To thigh up the bag was much harder
work then I expected. Just to enter the BOM took about&nbsp; 12 hours.
Had to submit after each component added and after that the site needed
to update the window which took plenty of time. Then it all still timed
out from time to time.&nbsp; For a while I thought I lost all of the
BOM. Oh.. well... I survived.&nbsp; I hope the engineers at Microchip
does not have to use this system on a daily basis. Maybe as a
punishment if they do something wrong. ;-)&nbsp; Did a simple update of
the description also finding that everything was messed up. Took me
almost four hours to get right again. But apart from using the site
this has been great fun.<br><br>Now I have a lot of neglected things to
take care of and after that I will start to do software work. &nbsp;I
will start with the MiWi and will send VSCP frames over it. I hardly
can't wait until I can start with this. It will be sooo fun!<br><br>If you <a href="http://www.mypic32.com/web/guest/contestantsprofiles?profileID=43308">look at my video</a>
or rather listen to it, you hear that I have a clicking sound in the
audio. I haven't yet discovered where this comes from. Anyone have a
clue? &nbsp;I haven't put to much energy on investigating this
problem&nbsp;at this time as I may use an AudioDAC in the end if the
PIC32 can handle streaming audio. <br><br>As everyone else in this
competition&nbsp;probably do I really hope I get a chance to continue
into the next phase. Not so much because of the prices but it
gives&nbsp;a chance to show more people what <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.vscp.org">VSCP</a> can do.&nbsp; I have my birthday a few days after the 29:th so a decision in favor of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SweetBox</span> among the 32 would be a great present. :)<br>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">God luck to everyone!</span><br><br><br>
